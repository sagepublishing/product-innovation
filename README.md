As part of the Product Innovation team at SAGE you can build your career through experience across our broad range of learning and research products and also through our career progression opportunities with roles at Associate, Product, Snr Product and Head of positions within the team (and the mirror levels in UX!).  We recently build out a Product Management Academy that support skills development through a combination of in house training coupled with external courses and resources.  

Our department sits within the wider Editorial group and works with pretty much every other department at SAGE from Marketing to Editorial to Finance to Customer Service, Circulation and Sales! Depending upon the product we sometimes work with in-house engineers, and sometimes with vendors.  We are a hybrid team with access to our London and Washington DC offices as well as support for remote working.
